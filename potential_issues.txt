the potential issues i can see where all the objects with the same name or id value have their hit value change when only one is targeted is in process,js line 167,
if not that it is how the objects are in the board in which case i will have to change the objects found in boards&ships.js line 135 and line 136.

note; there is some code in there that I am using for debugging on line 91 of battleships.js
      you can also set the second argument for calling the printBoard function to true to see the placement of ships
